# Security Policy

This program is made by a newer programmer who didn't put any thought into security beyond ensuring your secrets-files are individualized.  

I hold no responsibility as to what happens to your data or physical machine through the use of this program.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities in the "discussions" board by creating a new thread...and I'll see if I have the technical know-how to even attempt to fix them.

You can expect an update on a reported vulnerability within 5 business days of the original report.
